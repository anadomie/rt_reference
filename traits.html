						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>Amorphous</td>
								<td>A creature with this trait may increase or decrease its Size trait value by 1 as a
									Free Action (though doing so does not change its movement values). A creature with
									this trait also has the Crawler trait.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Amphibious</td>
								<td>If this trait is taken by a creature with the ability to breathe another substance
									other than air (i.e., water, ammonia, carbon-dioxide, etc.) then it can breathe air
									as well as its native atmosphere.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Auto-Stabilised</td>
								<td>These beings always count as braced when firing heavy weapons and therefore may fire
									a weapon on full or semi-automatic without taking the Brace action first, and not
									suffer any penalties to hit.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Baneful Presence (X)</td>
								<td>All characters suffer a –10 penalty to Willpower tests taken while within X metres
									of the creature.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Bestial</td>
								<td>A creature with this trait never needs to make a Survival test whilst in its natural
									habitat. Unless starving or desperate, a Bestial creature must make a Challenging
									(+0) Willpower test when frightened, startled, or injured. If it fails, the creature
									flees.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Blind</td>
								<td>Blind creatures automatically fail all tests based on vision, and automatically fail
									all Ballistic Skill tests. Such creatures take a –30 penalty to Weapon Skill tests
									and most other tests that ordinarily involve or are benefited by vision.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Brutal Charge(X)</td>
								<td>When Charging, the creature deals an extra (X) points of damage on each hit it
									inflicts that turn.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Burrower (X)</td>
								<td>The number in parentheses (X) indicates its speed when burrowing. When a creature
									burrows, it leaves behind a tunnel. Characters with a Size trait value lower than
									the burrower can enter these areas without impediment. At the end of each round
									after the burrower passes, roll 1d10; on a result of 5 or lower, the tunnel
									collapses behind the creature.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Crawler</td>
								<td>The base move for a creature with this trait is half its normal movement rate (round
									up) as determined by its Agility bonus, but it does not take penalties for moving
									over difficult terrain.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Daemonic (X)</td>
								<td>Creatures with this trait increase their Toughness bonus against all damage by the
									number indicated in the parentheses (X), in the same manner as an Unnatural
									Characteristic (see page 139), and stack if the latter also increases Toughness.
									This increase is negated by damage inflicted from force weapons, psychic powers,
									holy attacks, or other creatures with this trait. Daemonic creatures are also immune
									to disease and poison, gain the Undying trait, and gain benefits when using psychic
									powers as detailed in Chapter VI: Psychic Powers.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Dark-Sight</td>
								<td>A creature with this trait sees normally even in areas of total darkness, and never
									takes a penalty for fighting in areas of dim or no lighting.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Deadly Natural Weapons</td>
								<td>The creature gains all the benefits of the Natural Weapons trait (see page 137),
									except that its attacks no longer have the Primitive weapon quality.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Fear (X)</td>
								<td>The Fear trait always has an associated rating (1–4) to reflect how awful the
									creature is to behold; this is indicated by the number in parentheses (X). The
									higher the Fear rating, the harder it is for others to resist going insane from the
									encounter, as shown on Table 4–5: Fear Rating. When a character encounters a
									creature with this trait, the character must make a Willpower test with a penalty
									based on the creature’s Fear rating. If he succeeds, the character suffers no ill
									effects; if he fails, he must roll on Table 8-11: Shock (see page 287), adding +10
									to the roll for every degree of failure on the test.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Flyer (X)</td>
								<td>The number in parentheses (X) indicates its speed when flying. This number replaces
									the creature’s Agility bonus for movement actions while airborne. For more details
									on flying, see page 249 of Chapter VII: Combat.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>From Beyond</td>
								<td>Such a creature is immune to Fear, Pinning, Insanity points, and psychic powers used
									to cloud, control, or delude its mind.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Hoverer (X)</td>
								<td>The number in parentheses (X) indicates its speed when hovering; this number
									replaces its Agility bonus for purposes of calculating Movement while airborne. For
									more details on flying, see page 249 of Chapter VII: Combat.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Incorporeal</td>
								<td>"Incorporeal creatures gain the Hoverer (6) trait and a +30 bonus on Stealth tests
									due to their ability to merge with objects and nearly silent movement. An
									Incorporeal creature is also immune to normal weapons, which simply pass
									ineffectually through its body. Daemons, psychic powers, Warp creatures, other
									Incorporeal creatures, and opponents armed with force weapons can all injure an
									Incorporeal creature normally. An Incorporeal creature cannot usually affect the
									mortal world, and thus cannot damage normal opponents unless it has a suitable
									special ability or talent. Certain devices can keep these creatures at bay, though,
									most notably a Void Shield or a spaceship’s Gellar Field, which acts as an
									impenetrable barrier to them."</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Machine (x)</td>
								<td>Machines do not breathe, are immune to vacuum, extremes of cold, and
									mind-influencing psychic effects. Machines have a certain number of Armour points
									(indicated by the number in parentheses). This armour stacks with worn armour, but
									not with the Natural Armour trait, and provides resistance against damage from Fire
									(see page 243)</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Machanicus Implants</td>
								<td>Allows access to Mechanicus only implants and talents</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Navigator</td>
								<td>Allows acces to Navigator Abilities</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Mind Lock</td>
								<td>If faced with a situation outside of its programming and with no recognised master
									to issue orders, the creature must pass a Routine (+20) Intelligence test or be
									Stunned for 1 round. Due to its essentially mindless nature, at the GM’s discretion
									it is immune to all Opposed Social tests.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Multiple Arms (X)</td>
								<td>The exact number of arms is indicated in parentheses (X), so a Genestealer with
									Multiple Arms (4) has four arms total. It gains a +10 bonus on Athletics tests
									involving climbing and swimming. In addition, for each full pair of arms it has (the
									Multiple Arms value divided by 2) it can make an additional attack as if wielding
									multiple melee weapons. In this case, the creature must either have natural weapons
									or actual melee weapons to wield for this to take effect. Note that a creature still
									requires the Two-Weapon Wielder (Melee or Ranged) talent to make multiple attacks in
									the same turn.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Natural Armor (X)</td>
								<td>The number in parentheses (X) indicates how many Armour points the creature gains to
									all locations. Natural Armour stacks with worn armour, but not with the Machine
									trait.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Natural Weapons</td>
								<td>It counts as being armed even when not wielding weapons, with attacks that deal 1d10
									points of damage plus its Strength bonus. The creature can make attacks with its
									Natural Weapons using its Weapon Skill, though it cannot Parry with its natural
									weapons, nor can it be disarmed unless, of course, its limbs are hacked off. In
									general, creatures with Natural Weapons are immune to the Power Field quality, as it
									is assumed they have enough teeth, claws, or spines to ignore a few being removed.
									Natural weapons have the Primitive (7) weapon quality unless stated otherwise in the
									profile.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Phase</td>
								<td>As a Half Action, the creature may gain or remove the Incorporeal trait, becoming
									insubstantial or solid.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Psyker</td>
								<td>Though this trait has no benefits on its own, it allows characters to purchase the
									Psyniscience skill and psychic powers. All psykers have a psy rating (or PR; see
									page 193) which is listed out for each NPC.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Quadruped</td>
								<td>Quadrupeds are much quicker over a distance than their bipedal counterparts, and
									their movement is double that normally indicated by their Agility bonus (see page
									245). Creatures with more than four legs may gain this trait as well, increasing
									their movement as indicated above but adding an additional 2 (after doubling) to
									their final movement rate for each set of legs beyond the first two pairs (i.e., +2
									for 6 legs, +4 for 8 legs, etc.).</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Regeneration (X)</td>
								<td>Each round, at the start of its turn, the creature can make a Toughness test to
									remove an amount of damage indicated in the parentheses after the trait.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Sanctioned</td>
								<td>If a Sanctioned character gains the Psyker elite advance, he does not gain the
									Corruption normally inflicted with that advance and starts at psy rating of 2
									instead of 1.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Size (X)</td>
								<td>Size affects movement, how well the creature can hide and move undetected, and how
									easy or hard it is to strike in combat. When calculating movement, apply the size
									modifier first, and then other modifiers from other traits or talents (such as
									Quadruped). Note that a creature’s movement cannot be reduced to less than 1.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Sonar</td>
								<td>Sense Allows the creature to locate the position of any solid object within 30
									metres. Other creatures within this 30 metre range that succeed on a Difficult (–10)
									Awareness skill can detect the oddly-pitched sounds echoing around them.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Soul Bound</td>
								<td>"A soul bound psyker rolls an extra die when forced to roll on Table 6–3: Perils of
									the Warp (see page 197), then replaces either the ones die or the tens die with the
									extra die he rolled to determine the final result. Upon becoming soul-bound, the
									psyker must choose one of the following effects: 3d10 Insanity points, the permanent
									loss of his sight, permanent loss of 1d10 points from one characteristic, or a
									random mutation. In addition, a soul bound character is permanently indebted to the
									entity, which undoubtedly entails all manner of other duties and consequences."</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Stampede</td>
								<td>Whenever a creature with this trait fails a Willpower test, it automatically moves
									in a straight line forwards as far as possible, overrunning anything in its path
									until the source of danger is escaped or crushed under hoof. Anyone in the way
									suffers a single hit from the creature’s Natural Weapons (or 1d5+SB Impact damage if
									it does not have that trait). One stampeding creature automatically causes all other
									creatures with the same trait within sight to stampede as well. The stampede lasts
									until the source of danger is no longer visible or for 1d10 minutes, whichever
									occurs last.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Stuff of Nightmares</td>
								<td>Such creatures count as having the Undying trait, and are completely immune to most
									environmental hazards, Blood Loss, and Stunning. They also ignore any Critical
									Effect other than one that would destroy them outright, unless it was caused by a
									psychic power, force weapon, or holy attack.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Sturdy</td>
								<td>Gains a +20 bonus to tests made to resist Grappling and Knock Down actions, and uses
									of the Takedown talent.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Touched by the Fates (X)</td>
								<td>The NPC has a number of Fate points shown in parentheses (X). It can use these Fate
									points in exactly the same way as Player Characters and can even burn a Fate point
									to survive death and destruction at the GM’s discretion. The NPC’s attacks also use
									the rules for Righteous Fury.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Toxic (X)</td>
								<td>A character that successfully deals damage to a Toxic creature in melee combat must
									make a Toughness test at the end of his turn with a penalty equal to 10 times the
									number in parentheses (X), or suffer 1d10 points of Energy damage not reduced by
									Armour or Toughness. For example, a creature with Toxic (4) would impose a –40 on
									Toughness tests. Some creatures carry additional effects with their toxins, or
									inflict more damage as indicated in their individual descriptions.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Undying</td>
								<td>It cannot be harmed by diseases, poisons, or toxic effects. It also has no need to
									breathe, and thus can survive unaided in a vacuum.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Unnatural Agility (X)</td>
								<td>Adds X to Agility bonus. Successful tests using Agility gain a number of bonus
									degrees of success equal to half the Unnatural Characteristic value.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Unnatural Ballistic Skill (X)</td>
								<td>Adds X to Ballistic Skill bonus. Successful tests using Ballistic Skill gain a
									number of bonus degrees of success equal to half the Unnatural Characteristic value.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Unnatural Fellowship (X)</td>
								<td>Adds X to Fellowship bonus. Successful tests using Fellowship gain a number of bonus
									degrees of success equal to half the Unnatural Characteristic value.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Unnatural Intelligence (X)</td>
								<td>Adds X to Intelligence bonus. Successful tests using Intelligence gain a number of
									bonus degrees of success equal to half the Unnatural Characteristic value.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Unnatural Perception (X)</td>
								<td>Adds X to Perception bonus. Successful tests using Perception gain a number of bonus
									degrees of success equal to half the Unnatural Characteristic value.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Unnatural Senses (X)</td>
								<td>The creature can perceive its surroundings using senses other than sight or hearing,
									such as special organs, fine hairs, or some other disturbing ability. This trait
									always includes a range in metres indicated by the number in parentheses (X).</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Unnatural Strength (X)</td>
								<td>Adds X to Strength bonus. Successful tests using Strength gain a number of bonus
									degrees of success equal to half the Unnatural Characteristic value.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Unnatural Toughness (X)</td>
								<td>Adds X to Toughness bonus. Successful tests using Toughness gain a number of bonus
									degrees of success equal to half the Unnatural Characteristic value.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Unnatural Weapon Skill (X)</td>
								<td>Adds X to Weapon Skill bonus. Successful tests using Weapon Skill gain a number of
									bonus degrees of success equal to half the Unnatural Characteristic value.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Unnatural Willpower (X)</td>
								<td>Adds X to Willpower bonus. Successful tests using Willpower gain a number of bonus
									degrees of success equal to half the Unnatural Characteristic value.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Warp Instability</td>
								<td>If a creature with this trait takes damage and does not deal any damage or Insanity
									points to another creature by the end of its next turn, it must make a Willpower
									test. The creature suffers 1 point of damage for failing, plus 1 additional point of
									damage for each degree of failure. If this would deal damage equal to (or in excess
									of) the creature’s wounds, it is cast back into the Warp.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Warp Weapons</td>
								<td>Natural weapons and attacks made by a creature with this trait ignore physical
									armour, unless the armour is created from psychoactive materials or is somehow
									warded against the Warp. Force fields still work against these attacks normally.
								</td>
