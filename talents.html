							<tr>
								<td>Adamantium Faith</td>
								<td>Jaded, Resistance (Fear), WP 45</td>
								<td>The Acolyte has become inured to horrors that would cripple lesser men. This might
									come from years of facing incoming fire, staring down the terrors of the Warp, or
									simply his absolute faith in the Emperor. He can subtract his Willpower bonus from
									his degrees of failure on a failed Fear or Pinning test. If this reduces the result
									to zero or less, he counts as having passed the Fear test with 1 degree of success.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Air of Authority</td>
								<td>Fel 30</td>
								<td>When addressing characters with military background, the character gains +10 to
									Fellowship tests.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Ambassador Imperialis</td>
								<td>Fel 35, Int 35</td>
								<td>Whether from serving in the fleet of a Rogue Trader or dealing with xenos
									mercenaries on frontier worlds, the Acolyte is experienced in dealing with alien and
									the most divergent of non- Imperial cultures, able to avoid the subtle faux pas that
									can so easily cause a negotiation to deteriorate into bloodshed. The character
									reduces any penalty to Interaction skill tests for dealing with xenos or
									non-Imperial NPCs by 20. In addition, once per encounter, he can reroll a failed
									Interaction skill test when interacting with such an NPC.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Ambidextrous</td>
								<td>Ag 30</td>
								<td>This talent does not represent true ambidexterity so much as sufficient training
									with both hands to make the distinction moot. When combined with Two-Weapon Wielder
									talent, the penalty for making attacks with both weapons in the same turn drops to
									–10.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Archivator</td>
								<td>Int 40</td>
								<td>Whether through years of experience or specialised training, the Acolyte is a master
									of mining information from the Imperium’s countless archives. From delving into deep
									info-crypts to searching mouldering librarium stacks and deciphering ancient
									tech-slabs, the Acolyte can uncover knowledge thought long lost. When making a
									Scholastic Lore or Forbidden Lore test utilising sources of recorded information of
									any sort, such as cogitators, tomes, info-nets, and data-slates, the character can
									reroll a failed test once with a –10 penalty. In addition, tests to perform research
									or find information in these circumstances take half the usual time.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Armour-Monger</td>
								<td>Int 35, Tech-Use, Trade (Armourer)</td>
								<td>The Acolyte is a skilled armourer, and constantly tinkers and improves his armour,
									or keeps it in pristine shape by repairing the slightest damage it sustains. With
									years of training, he has even learned to enhance the protection afforded by his
									armour and how to use it to its optimum. The character gains an extra amount of
									Armour points equal to his Intelligence bonus, which he can distribute to any
									locations that his armour would normally cover, as long as he has at least an hour
									each day to clean and repair it or make minor modifications. This bonus applies only
									to armour when the Acolyte is wearing it, as it combines his training with his skill
									at armoury.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Assassin Strike</td>
								<td>Ag 40, Acrobatics</td>
								<td>The character’s natural agility and graceful martial form turn him into a dervish of
									death in combat. After making a melee attack, the character may make a Challenging
									(+0) Acrobatic test; if he succeeds, he may move up to his Half Move distance as a
									Free Action.. He may only make this move once per round, and the character’s
									opponent does not receive a free attack resulting from this move.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Bastion of Iron Will</td>
								<td>Psy Rating, Strong Minded, WP 40</td>
								<td>The Acolyte’s sheer willpower and psychic focus have become one and the same, over
									years of practice and training, such that their combined use is second nature. He
									adds 5 x his psy rating to any Opposed test he makes when defending against psychic
									powers.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Battle Rage</td>
								<td>Frenzy</td>
								<td>Long experience and indomitable will have allowed the character to master the beast
									within, directing its rage while keeping his head, despite the howling bloodlust in
									his mind. The Acolyte can Parry while Frenzied, and can re-roll a failed test to
									snap out of Frenzy or resist entering Frenzy if he so chooses.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Blademaster</td>
								<td>WS 30, Weapon Training (any Melee)</td>
								<td>The Acolyte’s mastery of bladed weapons and their martial disciplines has no peer.
									When attacking with any bladed weapon, including chainswords, axes, and power
									swords, he can re-roll one missed attack per round.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Blind Fighting</td>
								<td>Per 30</td>
								<td>Years of practice and development of his other senses allows the Acolyte to fight in
									close combat without the benefit of sight. He ignores all penalties for fighting
									with a melee weapon while suffering from obscured vision, permitting him to fight in
									fog, smoke, or darkness more effectively. See page 229 for a full list of normal
									penalties based on lighting and vision. Note this talent only improves his chances
									to hit with melee weapons, and has no effect on ranged weapon attacks.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Bloodtracker</td>
								<td>-</td>
								<td>The Explorer is an experienced and cunning bounty hunter who commands the highest
									price for bringing in a quarry in dead or alive. When turning in a fugitive for
									bounty, the character’s group gains a bonus of +100 Objective Points towards
									Military or Criminal Objectives.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Bodyguard</td>
								<td>Ag 35</td>
								<td>After an enemy makes a successful attack against an ally, the character may use a
									Reaction to move up to his Half Move distance in order to interpose himself between
									the attacker and target. The attack is then resolved against the character instead
									of the original target. In the case of a melee attack, the character may also
									attempt to Parry the attack as part of his Reaction.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Bulging Biceps</td>
								<td>S 45</td>
								<td>Whereas a weaker man might be sent flying by the recoil of a heavy weapon, this
									Acolyte’s strong physique allows him to remain standing. He can fire a heavy weapon
									using Semi- Auto Burst or Full Auto Burst without bracing the weapon, and does not
									suffer the –30 penalty for failing to brace it. In addition, whenever he uses the
									Heft special use of the Athletics skill (see page 98) he can add +20 to his
									Athletics skill test to reflect his powerful musculature.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Bulwark of Faith</td>
								<td>WP 45, Iron Faith</td>
								<td>When the character passes a Fear test caused by a Daemon, the Daemon suffers 1
									Energy damage ignoring armour and Toughness bonus for each degree of success on the
									Fear test.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Catfall</td>
								<td>Ag 30</td>
								<td>Gymnastic ability and natural balance enables the Acolyte to fall great distances
									without harm. He automatically reduces the effective distance of all falls by a
									number of metres equal to his Agility bonus, ignoring this distance as if it did not
									exist. He also adds +20 to his Acrobatics skill tests when using the Jump special
									skill use, as it pertains to reducing damage from falling.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Cleanse and Purify</td>
								<td>Weapon Training (Flame), Willpower 35</td>
								<td>The character can control the flowering flow of promethium like no other,
									manipulating flame like an old accomplice. The targets of the character’s flamer
									attacks take a –20 penalty to their Agility tests to escape its effects, and when
									used against an enemy with the Horde trait, the number of hits on the Horde is
									increased by +1d5.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Clues from the Crowds</td>
								<td>Fel 30</td>
								<td>It is often difficult to extract information from groups such as hive gangs or
									Administratum scribes, as often numbers can bolster recalcitrance to questioning. A
									veteran Acolyte knows that such groups can hold critical information to complete an
									investigation, and can throw more effective nets when interrogating groups and
									reveal valued clues. Once per day, he can re-roll a test made to gather information
									from a group of people.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Combat Master</td>
								<td>WS 30</td>
								<td>The Acolyte’s weapon seems to be everywhere at once, keeping many more opponents at
									bay in close combat than would seem possible. Opponents fighting him in hand-to-hand
									combat gain no bonuses for Ganging Up (see page 229).</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Constant Vigilance*</td>
								<td>Int 35 or Per 35, Awareness +10</td>
								<td>From years of surviving ambushes and surprise attacks, the Acolyte is always ready
									for battle. His subconscious is alert to the slightest footstep or activation of a
									lasgun pack, and he acts often before he is fully aware of the threat. When this
									talent is taken, the character selects the Specialisation that matches the
									prerequisite (Perception or Intelligence) used in purchase. He can use the
									characteristic that matches that Specialisation when rolling for Initiative instead
									of his Agility value, and rolls two dice for the roll (picking the highest of the
									two for his score).</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Contact Network</td>
								<td>Cover-Up, Int 35</td>
								<td>Acolytes rely on a web of relationships, favours, debts, and obligations that can
									range from within a hab-block to spanning an entire system. Developing and
									exploiting this network properly allows them to gain access to weapons, travel
									berths, personnel, and other resources when needed; those who maximise their
									connections can ensure they are well-armed and well-prepared as they face a new
									heresy. An Acolyte with this talent can use his Fellowship characteristic in place
									of his Influence when making Requisition tests (see page 142).</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Coordinated Interrogation</td>
								<td>S 40 or WP 40, Clues from the Crowds, Interrogation</td>
								<td>A trained Acolyte, especially when working in conjunction with fellow veteran
									Acolytes, can induce cooperation from even the most hardened of suspects and
									captured heretics. He gains a +10 bonus to all Interrogation tests, and gains an
									additional +5 for each other character participating in the interrogation who also
									has Coordinated Interrogation. This counts as test assistance, and thus also gains
									the standard assistance bonuses as per page 25.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Counter Attack</td>
								<td>WS 40</td>
								<td>The Acolyte’s lightning ripostes are things of deadly beauty; swift and invisible as
									the wind. Once per turn, after successfully Parrying an opponent’s attack, this
									character may immediately make a Standard Attack action as a Free Action against
									that opponent using the weapon with which he Parried. The character suffers a –20
									penalty on the Weapon Skill test for this attack.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Cover-Up</td>
								<td>Int 35</td>
								<td>Even the slightest whisper of the Inquisition’s presence can be enough to scatter
									suspected heretics and drive cults into hiding. To prevent the growth and spread of
									rumours, Acolytes use combinations of well-placed bribes, dire threats, and other
									means to keep their activities as secretive as possible. At the GM’s discretion, the
									character can reduce his Influence to increase his group’s Subtlety. For every point
									of Influence lost in this way, the Acolyte increases his warband’s Subtlety by 1d5.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Crushing Blow</td>
								<td>WS 40</td>
								<td>The Acolyte has the ability to focus his entire body into close combat attacks. He
									adds half his Weapon Skill bonus (rounding up) to damage he inflicts with melee
									attacks.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Daemonhunter</td>
								<td>Forbidden Lore (Daemonology), WP 40</td>
								<td>The Acolyte may re-roll failed Awareness and Psyniscience tests to detect the
									presence of Daemons. In addition, his attacks against Daemons gain the Proven (3)
									quality.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Daemonologist</td>
								<td>Psy rating 3, WP 45, Forbidden Lore(Daemonology)</td>
								<td>When the character takes the Focus Power action and the target of the psychic power
									is a Daemon, he gains a +10 bonus to the Focus Power test. At the GM’s discretion,
									this bonus may apply to other tests, such as rituals to summon or bind a Daemon.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Dark Soul</td>
								<td>Hardened Soul, 20 Corruption points</td>
								<td>When the character would test to gain a mutation as a result of increasing
									Corruption, he may choose to automatically pass the test. If he does, he also gains
									a Malignancy and increases his Corruption total by 1d10.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Deathdealer*</td>
								<td>BS 45 or WS 45</td>
								<td>The Acolyte can place his hits where they inflict maximum harm, such as gaps or
									joints in armour. When this talent is taken, the character selects the
									Specialisation that matches the prerequisite used in purchase (Melee with Weapon
									Skill, Ranged with Ballistic Skill). When the character’s attack in that combat type
									inflicts Critical damage, he adds his Perception bonus to the damage result.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Decadence</td>
								<td>T 30</td>
								<td>When drinking alcohol or similar beverages, you not pass out until he you failed a
									number of Toughness Tests equal to twice your Toughness Bonus. The character also
									gains a +10 bonus to resist the effects of addiction.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Delicate Dealings</td>
								<td>Cover-Up, Deceive, Fel 50</td>
								<td>Whenever the Explorer’s dealings with Xenos would decrease the group’s Reputation,
									at GM’s discretion, the amount of Reputation lost is reduced by 1d5.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Delicate Interrogation</td>
								<td>Fel 50, Coordinated Interrogation</td>
								<td>Questioning suspects and witnesses is always a necessary part of any investigation.
									Such sessions must remain secretive or obscured, however, lest others learn of the
									Inquisition’s interest, and a variety of subterfuges, deceptions, and outright
									threats come into play to aid this effort. Whenever the Acolyte would decrease his
									warband’s Subtlety due to an interrogation, the amount of Subtlety lost is reduced
									by 1d5. If this results in a negative number, the Acolyte’s skilled efforts increase
									the warband’s Subtlety by 1.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Deny the Witch</td>
								<td>WP 35</td>
								<td>The Acolyte draws on his faith and mental fortitude to act as his shield against
									those tainted by the Warp. The character may use his Willpower characteristic when
									making an Evasion Reaction against ranged or melee attacks against him made with
									psychic powers. When successfully evading an attack with an area of effect, the
									character does not move but instead is simply unaffected by the psychic power.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Devastating Assault</td>
								<td>WS 35</td>
								<td>The Acolyte launches a furious attack on his foe, the rage of the Emperor powering
									his assault. Once per turn, after resolving an All Out Attack action that
									successfully hits, the character may make a second All Out Attack action against the
									same target as a Free Action, with the same bonuses and penalties as the first.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Die Hard</td>
								<td>WP 40</td>
								<td>Through either mental resolve or sheer stubbornness, the Acolyte refuses to fall.
									When this character would suffer a level of Fatigue due to the Blood Loss condition,
									he makes a Challenging (+0) Willpower test; if he succeeds, he does not suffer a
									level of Fatigue.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Disarm</td>
								<td>Ag 30</td>
								<td>The Acolyte can wrest weapons from his opponents’ hands through practised technique
									or brute force. As a Full Action, the character may make an Opposed Weapon Skill
									test against one target with whom he is engaged. If the Acolyte wins the test, the
									enemy drops his weapon to the ground. Should the Acolyte score three or more degrees
									of success, he can take the enemy’s weapon from him.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Divine Protection</td>
								<td>BS 45, WP 35</td>
								<td>Those who hunt the witch and mutant often prefer to use cleansing ire to purify
									their unclean enemies. As if to further demonstrate the cleansing power of flame,
									some such blessed warriors even use flamers and similar weapons when their allies
									are in the line of fire, yet miraculously leave them unafected. If a supposed ally
									does succumb to the flames, surely that is only evidence of concealed heresy. When
									the Acolyte attacks using a weapon with the Spray quality, it only strikes enemies
									within the area of efect; the attack does not harm allies.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Double Tap</td>
								<td>Two-Weapon Wielder</td>
								<td>The Acolyte is practiced in making dual attacks, and can almost subconsciously tell
									when his hits strike to best effect. When making a second ranged attack action in
									the same turn against the same target, he gains a +20 bonus to the attack test if
									his first attack scored one or more successful hits.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Double Team</td>
								<td>-</td>
								<td>The Acolyte has experience of fighting in paired teams that work together to take
									down their enemies. When Ganging Up on an opponent, he gains an additional +10 bonus
									to Weapon Skill tests. If both the characters that outnumber the enemy have this
									talent, then both gain an additional +10 bonus, for a total of +20. This bonus is in
									addition to the normal bonus gained from Ganging Up on an opponent (see page 229).
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Enemy*</td>
								<td>-</td>
								<td>The opposite of Peer (see page 130); the Acolyte is particularly despised and
									possibly hunted by a specific social group or organisation, heretical cult, or xenos
									race. He suffers an additional –10 penalty to Fellowship and Influence tests when
									dealing with this group, and the GM can use them to complicate his life from time to
									time. Unlike other talents, Enemy does not cost any xp to purchase and cannot be
									taken as an advance. Instead the GM and player can agree to award it when
									appropriate to the adventure or campaign. It can be removed with the approval of the
									GM, if the character has redeemed himself with the group in question. The Enemy
									talent can be awarded multiple times for the same group, in which case it should be
									listed as Enemy (X), with X equalling the number of times the talent has been
									awarded. This can be used to represent groups who particularly hate the Acolyte and
									want to see him dead. In game terms, the penalty to Fellowship tests increases to
									–10 times X.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Exceptional Lord-Captain</td>
								<td>Command +30, Lord-Captain of a Voidship</td>
								<td>The Explorer knows the ins and outs of being a commander of a vessel that houses
									tens of thousands of people. They all know him one of another as being the only
									person that can lead them to victory and salvation in the void. The voidship that
									the character is Lord-Captain of increases permanently Morale by the Explorer’s
									Fellowship Bonus. This is lost once the character is off the ship, dies or is
									removed from the position.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Exotic Weapon Training*</td>
								<td>-</td>
								<td>The Acolyte is trained to use a particularly obscure type of weapon, such as a
									graviton gun or needle pistol. Weapons requiring this unique talent are noted in
									their armoury descriptions. Unlike other kinds of weapons training, this talent
									applies only to a single weapon type and not a class of weapons. Note that an Exotic
									weapon with the Heavy class would also require the Weapon Training (Heavy) talent as
									well as Exotic Weapon Training in that specific weapon.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Eye of Vengeance</td>
								<td>BS 50</td>
								<td>The Acolyte can focus his intent on where it is likely to do most damage to his
									enemy and then strike his foe down with a single shot. Before making a ranged
									Standard Attack action, he can spend a Fate point. If he does so, he adds the number
									of degrees of success scored on the attack test to both his damage and penetration
									for the hit.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Face in a Crowd</td>
								<td>Fel 35, Clues from the Crowds</td>
								<td>A successful investigation often involves trailing suspects without their knowledge,
									the better to follow them to hidden dens of heretical worship or criminal activity.
									With training, the Acolyte can ensure none notice his presence, through careful
									replication of a crowd’s mannerisms or even joining gatherings while still keeping a
									careful eye on his quarry. When employing the Shadowing special use of the Stealth
									skill, he can use his Fellowship characteristic instead of his Agility.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Favoured by the Warp</td>
								<td>WP 35</td>
								<td>Whenever this character rolls on Table 6–2: Psychic Phenomena (see page 196), he may
									roll a second time and choose which result he receives.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Ferric Summons</td>
								<td>Ferric Lure Implants, Mechanicus Implants</td>
								<td>The Acolyte has trained himself in better use of his Ferric Lure Implants (see page
									182). He can summon to his hand an unsecured metal object weighing up to 2 kilograms
									per point of his Willpower bonus, and can summon such objects up to 40 metres
									distant.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Field Vivisection*</td>
								<td>BS or WS 40, Forbidden Lore (Xenos–Any), Rank 2 Medicae</td>
								<td>Make Medicae test in place of WS or BS against targets with appropiate lore for.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Flagellant</td>
								<td>WP30</td>
								<td>The Acolyte knows that pain is cleansing, and regularly mortiies his own lesh to
									atone for his sins. As a Full Action, the character can inlict some suitable
									punishment on his own body, sufering 1d5–2 levels of Fatigue (to a minimum of 1). He
									then gains a +10 bonus on Willpower tests to resist Fear, Pinning, psychic powers,
									or sufering Corruption, for one hour or until the end of the current encounter. If
									the Acolyte also possesses the Frenzy talent, he can enter a Frenzied state as a
									Free Action while under the efects of this talent.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Flash of Insight</td>
								<td>Int 40, Contact Network, Coordinated Interrogation</td>
								<td>Despite steady application of logic and careful analysis, some conundrums remain
									insoluble, but inspiration could come from outside sources, such as reading patterns
									from wisps of lho smoke or even making direct appeals to the Emperor for guidance.
									An Acolyte who has trained his mind to process such lateral data can leap to
									conclusions that direct thinking cannot provide, and thus quash even the most hidden
									of heresies. When stuck in an investigation, he can spend one Fate point to reveal a
									single clue or lead to aid in the progression of his efforts.</td>
							</tr>

								<td>Grenadier</td>
								<td>BS 35</td>

									the Blast quality, he may reduce the distance it scatters by a number of metres up
									to half his BS bonus.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Halo of Command</td>
								<td>Fel 40, WP 40</td>
								<td>The Acolyte has trained himself to better to lead and sway others, either motivating

									through skills that have either the Social or Leadership Aptitudes (such as Charm,
									Command, and Intimidate), he may affect a number of targets up to 100 times his

								<td>Hammer Blow</td>
								<td>Crushing Blow</td>
								<td>The Acolyte strikes a single blow with such focus and force that it breaks armour
									and pulps flesh as it strikes. When he uses an All Out Attack action to make a

									penetration. The attack also counts as having the Concussive (2) weapon quality, to
									represent the shocking force of the blow’s impact.</td>

									without his eye behind the sights. As a Full Action, he can both move up to his Full
									Move rate and make a single attack with a ranged weapon. This attack can only be a
									single shot, and so cannot be a semi- or full-automatic ranged attack for example.

									operator attempting such manoeuvres.When the Acolyte succeeds on an Operate test (or
									Survival test in the case of a living steed), he may voluntarily suffer 1 level of

								<td>The sheer power of the Acolyte’s mind allows him to channel vast amounts of Warp
									energy when he chooses. When Pushing (see page 194), before rolling his Focus Power
									test the character may spend one Fate Point to add an additional 1d5 to the
									effective psy rating of the power. Channelling such vast amounts of power is
									dangerous, however, and so he adds +30 to rolls on Table 6–2: Psychic Phenomena when
									he makes as a result of this talent.</td>

								<td>Warp Lock</td>
								<td>Psy Rating, Strong Minded, WP 50</td>
								<td>The Acolyte has learned to swiftly cut himself off from the Warp to protect himself
									from harm. Once per game session, he may ignore the Psychic Phenomena he has rolled
									(including the Perils of the Warp result on Table 6–2: Psychic Phenomena, see page
									196), completely negating its effects. Such rapid dislocation from the Warp, though,
									is stressful and traumatic to his mind. He suffers 1d5 Energy damage to the Head
									location (not reduced by Armour or Toughness) as a result, and cannot make any Focus
									Power tests or sustain other psychic powers until the beginning of his next turn.

								<td>Warp Sense</td>
								<td>Psy Rating, Psyniscience, Per 30</td>
								<td>The Acolyte’s senses have evolved to perceive the Warp in parallel with the physical
									world. The character can use the Psyniscience Skill as a Free Action instead of as a
									Half Action. He can also passively detect psychic effects and entities without the
									need to actively seek them out. Whenever the character could detect such a Warp
									signature or a creature, the GM can allow him to make a Psyniscience skill test to
									detect it, in the same way he could use Awareness to spot an ambush without knowing
									it is there.</td>

								<td>In the prosecution of his duties against the alien, the Acolyte wields the most
									arcane and rare weapons the Adeptus Mechanicus can craft, and perhaps even takes up
									the very armaments of the xenos to better combat it. From years of experience, the
									character can quickly discern the firing mechanisms and balance of even the
									strangest weapons, regardless of its origin.The character reduces the penalty for
									using a weapon without the proper training by 10.</td>

								<td>Weapon Training*</td>

								<td>The Acolyte can use all weapons with Class: Pistol, Basic, Melee, Throwing, and
									Vehicle within the group he has selected with this talent. When a character attempts
									to use a weapon he does not have the correct Weapon Training talent for, he suffers
									a –20 penalty to any relevant Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill test. The character
									can only use weapons with Class: Heavy without suffering the –20 penalty if he has
									both Weapon Training in the appropriate group and Weapon Training (Heavy). This
									talent can be taken more than once, each time with a different Specialisation. Note
									that a character without the Weapon Training (Low-Tech) talent operating a weapon
									that functions as a Low-Tech weapon in certain circumstances does not suffer this
									penalty, so long as he has the applicable Weapon Training talent for the weapon
									(Power for a power sword, for example).</td>

								<td>The Acolyte calls upon the blessings of the Omnissiah, channelling his faith into
									his weapon and performing armament rituals to more readily smite his foes. Once per
									combat encounter, as a Free Action, this character may enhance any Melta, Plasma,
									Power, or Exotic weapon he is personally wielding. This increases the weapon’s
									damage and penetration by an amount equal to the character’s Intelligence bonus
									until the end of the round.</td>

									Half Action, the character may make one Standard Attack action (see page 224) with a
									melee weapon against a foe, plus one additional Standard Attack action with the same
									weapon targeting each other foe also engaged in melee combat with the character
									beyond the first (to a maximum number of attacks up to his Weapon Skill bonus).</td>
