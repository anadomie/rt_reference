									the longer the psyker sustains the power. If the target of this power is a
									character, he must pass a Challenging (+0) Agility test each round the psyker

									rounds. If used during narrative time, the psyker instead chooses a time within the
									next PR hours for the target to experience the omen. The GM determines the efects on
									the target’s behaviour, but a likely result is that the target rethinks his current
									course of action or direction he is travelling. The GM should use the psyker’s

									experiences. These are not thoughts in the sense of a sentient being, but merely
									vague impressions and unclear images. The GM determines the level of detail and form
									of the information received based on the intelligence and senses of the animal, as
									well as the PR of the psyker. The amount of information is based on the psyker’s
									degrees of success on the Focus Power test.
									Empathic Link: The psyker establishes a bond with the animal that persists after the
									telepathic link ends. The animal follows the psyker and obeys his commands to the
									best of its ability, exactly as if he had tamed and trained it with the Wrangling
									special use of the Survival skill (see page 116 of the DARK HERESY Core Rulebook)

									final psy rating used. Following are some broad guidelines, but GMs can further
									alter the range of the power as needed.
									• PR 1–3: The psyker can alter subtle flesh shapes, tones, and colours to distort
									the appearance of the target. He does not have direct control over what the end
									result looks like.
									• PR 4–6: The psyker can alter flesh, hair, eyes, and any other physical features.
									He can choose how the features will be altered, but does not have the precision to
									mimic others.
									• PR 7–9: The psyker can change any physical feature of the target to resemble
									another individual. However, the psyker must have a pic record of the individual, or
									have seen him before.
									• PR 10+: The psyker can shape his target to exactly mimic another individual.
									Additionally, he can use the power to morph the target into a form that no longer
									appears human.
									All tests to identify the target’s true identity suffer a penalty equal to 5 x PR

									Trait equal to his 5x the Psy Rating.
									When resting or otherwise not engaged in strenuous activity, he may opt to use the

									Rating per day of rest while using the Regeneration power in this mode. Though this
									mechanism of healing is far slower than the combat version, it allows the body to

									in addition to enhancing one sense beyond its normal ability. The psyker receives
									+30 Bonus to any Perception based Test (such as with the Awareness Skill) when using
									the selected sense. Sharpening some senses grants additional benefits:
									• Smell: Sharpening the sense of smell grants the psyker an additional +20 bonus on
									a Survival Skill Test to track when the psyker has an item belonging to the
									individual being tracked (a piece of clothing, a freshly severed appendage, etc.).
									This bonus stacks with the +30 granted normally by this power.
									• Touch: A psyker with a heightened sense of touch may “see” objects as he touches
									them, regardless of available light. For example, he may run his fingers across
									embossed script to read it in a pitch-black room.
									• Taste: Those trained in this power have had to test their senses as part of the
									process of learning its use. So honed is the psyker’s sense of taste while enhanced
									by this power that he can recognise the presence of poison in foods he samples by
									making a successful Challenging (+0) Awareness Test. This test is made prior to
									swallowing any food and thus, assuming the food is not laden with a massive dose of
									poison, he may spit it out before it takes effect.
									Sharpened Senses lasts for a number of rounds equal to the psyker’s Psy Rating. This
									power may be activated multiple times, each time with a new sense enhanced (although
									the +30 bonus remains the same, regardless of how many times the power is used).
									An unusual use of this power is to cause a reverse of its effects. Many experiences
									in the galaxy are best left for one’s enemies and as such, the canny biomancer turns
									off his senses when the situation calls for it. With a use of this power, the psyker
									may choose to turn off one of his senses (such as sight in order to avoid blindness
									in the face of intense light, or touch whilst under interrogation by cruel Eldar
									raiders). When doing so, he gains neither the +30 bonus to Perception based Tests
									nor the Unnatural Senses (5) Trait.</td>
