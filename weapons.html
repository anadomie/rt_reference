									after the first. Both are limited to +20 to damage.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Balanced</td>
								<td>Balanced weapons grant a +10 bonus to Weapon Skill tests made to Parry. Even if the
									wielder is using multiple Balanced weapons, he only gains the bonus once.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Blast (X)</td>
								<td>Attacks from this weapon explode on impact. When working out a hit from a Blast
									weapon, anyone within the weapon’s blast radius in metres, indicated by the number
									in parentheses, is also suffers a single hit from the weapon. Roll damage once and
									apply it to each character affected by the blast. A Blast weapon also scatters when
									the user fails his Ballistic Skill test when firing it.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Concussive (X)</td>
								<td>When a target is struck by a Concussive weapon, he must take a Toughness test with a
									penalty equal to 10 times the number in parentheses (X). If he fails, the target is
									Stunned for 1 round per degree of failure. If the attack also inflicted an amount of
									damage greater than the target’s Strength bonus, the target is knocked Prone.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Corrosive</td>
								<td>If a target is struck by an attack from a Corrosive weapon, the Armour points of any
									armour worn by the target in that location are reduced by 1d10 points. If the Armour
									points of the armour are reduced below 0 or the target is not wearing any armour in
									that location, the excess amount of Armour point damage (or the whole amount if the
									target is wearing no armour in that location) is dealt to the target. This excess
									damage is not reduced by Toughness. A target’s armour can be reduced multiple times
									by the effects of a Corrosive weapon, and the Armour point damage is cumulative. A
									suit of armour can be repaired with a successful Challenging (+0) Tech-Use test.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Crippling (X)</td>
								<td>When a target suffers at least one wound from this weapon, he is considered Crippled
									for the remainder of the encounter or until healed of all damage. If a Crippled
									character takes more than a Half Action on his turn, he suffers Rending damage equal
									to the number in parentheses (X) to the Hit Location that suffered the original
									damage. This damage is not reduced by Armour or Toughness.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Daemonbane</td>
								<td>When used against targets with the Daemonic trait, weapons with this quality gain
									the Vengeful (8) quality and their damage is not reduced by the target’s Toughness
									bonus.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Defensive</td>
								<td>A weapon with this quality grants a +15 bonus to tests made when used to Parry, but
									imposes a –10 penalty on tests to make attacks with it.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Felling (X)</td>
								<td>When calculating damage from Felling weapons, reduce the target’s Unnatural
									Toughness bonus by the number in parentheses (X). Felling only reduces Unnatural
									Toughness, not the target’s base Toughness bonus, and does not persist once the
									damage has been calculated.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Flame</td>
								<td>Whenever a target is struck by an attack with this quality (even if he suffers no
									damage), he must make an Agility test or be set on fire. If the target of the Flame
									attack is a vehicle, the pilot must make the appropriate Operate skill test with a
									bonus equal to the vehicle’s Armour value on the facing hit by the Flame attack. If
									the pilot fails, the vehicle immediately catches fire.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Flexible</td>
								<td>These are often made of linked metal, rope, or other non-rigid materials that deny
									defensive counters. They cannot be Parried, though they themselves can be used to
									Parry an opponent’s weapon.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Force</td>
								<td>Force weapons count as Best craftsmanship Mono variants of the equivalent Low-Tech
									weapon. In the hands of a psyker, the weapon also deals bonus damage and gains bonus
									penetration equal to the psyker’s base psy rating, and the damage type changes to
									Energy. In addition, whenever a psyker damages an opponent, he may take a Focus
									Power action (Opposed with Willpower) as a Half Action. If he wins the test, then
									for every degree of success, the Force weapon’s wielder deals an additional 1d10
									Energy damage, ignoring Armour and Toughness bonus. Psykers always use their base
									psy rating when determining psychic strength for this test, and cannot generate
									Psychic Phenomena on this test. Force weapons cannot be destroyed by weapons with
									the Power Field quality.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Graviton</td>
								<td>When a weapon with the Graviton quality hits a target, it inflicts additional damage
									equal to the target’s Armour points on the struck location. If the target is a
									vehicle or cover, it instead inflicts additional damage equal to the Armour points
									of the facing that the attack struck.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Hallucinogenic (X)</td>
								<td>When a creature is struck by a weapon with the Hallucinogenic quality, it must make
									a Toughness test with a penalty equal to 10 times the number in parentheses (X) or
									suffer a temporary delusion and roll 1d10 on Table Hallucinogenic Effects.
									Respirators and sealed armour provide a +20 bonus to this test. The effects last for
									1 round, plus 1 additional round for every degree of failure.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Haywire (X)</td>
								<td>A foul affront to the Omnissiah in the eyes of many Tech-Priests, devices with this
									quality seek to cripple machine spirits and make metal as weak as flesh. Everything
									within the field’s radius, indicated by the number in parentheses, is affected;
									Haywire (3), for example, would affect an area with a three metre radius. Roll 1d10
									on Table Haywire Field Effects (adding any modifiers from the weapon) to determine
									the strength of the effect. As the field slowly dissipates, the strength lessens one
									step in severity each round until it becomes Insignificant (i.e., a result of Major
									Disruption would become Minor Disruption the following round and then cease to have
									an effect the round after that). Additional Haywire attacks in the same area do not
									stack but instead create a new effect that is either ignored if lower than the
									current effect or replaces the old one if higher.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Inaccurate</td>
								<td>A character gains no benefit from the Aim action when attacking with a weapon with
									this quality.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Indirect (X)</td>
								<td>Indirect weapons do not require line of sight to their target, but the attacker must
									still be aware of his intended target’s location, either through last known
									position, use of a spotter, or other means. When making any ranged attack action
									(Standard Attack, Semi-Auto Burst, or Full Auto Burst) with an Indirect weapon, the
									attack does not have to target a location in line of sight of the active player, but
									is made at a –10 penalty and requires a Full Action instead of the normal Half
									Action. The GM makes the final determination on whether the character is aware of
									his target’s location, and can add penalties to this ranged attack based on how
									aware the character is of his target. For each hit the ranged attack inflicts, roll
									once on the Scatter Diagram. The hit instead strikes the ground at a location a
									number of metres away from the intended target, in the direction rolled on the
									Scatter Diagram, equal to 1d10 minus the firer’s Ballistic Skill bonus (to a minimum
									of zero). If the ranged attack fails, or if the Semi-Auto Burst or Full Auto Burst
									actions fail to achieve the maximum potential hits, the remaining missed hits—up to
									the maximum potential hits for the rate of fire used in the attack—are still fired,
									but miss their target. For each missed hit, roll once on the Scatter Diagram. The
									hit instead strikes the ground at a location Xd10 metres away from the intended
									target in the direction rolled on the Scatter Diagram, where X is equal to the
									number in parentheses (X).</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Lance</td>
								<td>Weapons with this quality have a variable penetration value that is dependent on the
									accuracy of each shot. When a target is hit by a weapon with the Lance quality,
									increase the weapon’s penetration value by its base value once for each degree of
									success the attacker achieves. For example, if a Lance weapon had a base penetration
									value of 5 and hit with three degrees of success (adding 3x5=15), the total
									penetration for the attack would be 20.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Maximal</td>
								<td>As a Free Action, this weapon can be switched between two modes: Standard (which
									uses the normal weapon profile) and Maximal. When the weapon is fired on Maximal, it
									adds 10 metres to its range, 1d10 to its damage, and +2 to its penetration. If it
									has the Blast quality, then the value of this quality is increased by 2 (i.e., Blast
									[3] becomes Blast [5]). The weapon also uses three times the normal amount of
									ammunition per shot and gains the Recharge quality.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Melta</td>
								<td>This weapon doubles its penetration when firing at Short range or closer.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Overheats</td>
								<td>On an attack roll of 91 or higher, this weapon overheats. The wielder suffers Energy
									damage equal to the weapon’s damage with a penetration of 0 to an arm location (the
									arm holding the weapon if the weapon was fired one-handed, or a random arm if the
									weapon was fired with two hands). The wielder may choose to avoid taking the damage
									by dropping the weapon as a Free Action. A weapon that overheats must spend the
									round afterwards cooling down, and cannot be fired again until the second round
									after overheating. A weapon with this quality does not jam, and any effect that
									would cause the weapon to jam instead causes the weapon to overheat.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Power field</td>
								<td>When the character successfully uses this weapon to Parry an attack made with a
									weapon that lacks this quality, roll 1d100; on a result of 26 or higher, he destroys
									the attacker’s weapon. Weapons with the Warp Weapon or Force quality, and Natural
									Weapons, are immune to this effect.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Primitive (X)</td>
								<td>When rolling for damage with these weapons, any die result greater than the number
									in parentheses (X) counts as that number instead.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Proven (X)</td>
								<td>When rolling for damage with these weapons, any die result lower than the number in
									parentheses (X) counts as that number instead.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Razor Sharp</td>
								<td>If the wielder scores three or more degrees of success when attacking with this
									weapon, the weapon’s penetration value is doubled when resolving any hits from that
									attack.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Recharge</td>
								<td>When a weapon with this quality is used to make an attack, that weapon cannot be
									used to attack again until the end of the next round</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Reliable</td>
								<td>Reliable weapons only jam on an unmodified result of 100. Reliable weapons with the
									Spray quality, or which do not make hit rolls, never jam.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Sanctified</td>
								<td>Any damage inflicted by a Sanctified weapon counts as Holy damage, which can have
									unique effects against some terrible Daemons and other denizens of the Warp.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Scatter</td>
								<td>When fired at Point Blank range, this weapon gains +10 to hit and deals +3 damage.
									When fired at Short range, it gains +10 to hit. At any longer ranges, it suffers –3
									damage.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Shocking </td>
								<td>A target that takes at least 1 point of damage from a Shocking weapon (after Armour
									and Toughness bonus) must make a Challenging (+0) Toughness test. If he fails, he
									suffers 1 level of Fatigue and is Stunned for a number of rounds equal to half of
									his degrees of failure (rounding up).</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Smoke (X)</td>
								<td>Rather than inflicting damage, these weapons throw up dense clouds to create cover.
									When a hit is scored from a weapon with this quality, it creates a smokescreen at
									the point of impact with a radius in metres equal to the number in parentheses (X).
									This screen lasts for 1d10+10 rounds, or a shorter time in adverse weather
									conditions.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Snare (X)</td>
								<td>When a target is struck by a weapon with this quality, they must make a Challenging
									(+0) Strength or Agility test, with a penalty equal to the number listed in
									parentheses multiplied by ten. For example, a weapon with Snare (2) would cause a
									-20 penalty to the test. Also, gains +5 per Unnatural Strength or Unnatural Agility
									to this test. Also, -/+10 per Size difference between the attacker and target. It’s
									harder to snare something bigger than something smaller. On a failed test, the
									target is Snared. While Snared, the target takes a penalty to any actions that
									require a roll equal to the penalty to escape from the bonds, can only perform a
									single Half Action per Round (or a Half or Full Action to attempt to escape), and
									cannot take any actions with the Movement Subtype. The character must spend a Half
									or Full Action to attempt to escape their bonds with a Challenging (+0) Strength or
									Agility test, with the same penalty as when they were initially Snared. If the test
									is made at Half Action, the snared character doesn't gain bonuses for Unnatural
									Strength or Unnatural Agility. If the test is made at Full Action, the snared
									character gains +10 per Unnatural Strength or Unnatural Agility to the test. Both
									Half Action and Full Action gain -/+10 per Size difference between the attacker and
									snared.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Spray</td>
								<td>Spray weapons use large area-effect shots to strike more foes, sacrificing range for
									wider coverage. Unlike other weapons,they have just one range and, when fired, hit
									all those in their area of effect. The wielder does not need to test Ballistic
									Skill; all creatures in the weapon’s path (a cone-shaped area extending in a 30° arc
									from the firer out to the weapon’s range) must make a Challenging (+0) Agility test
									or suffer one hit from the weapon. If the wielder does not possess the appropriate
									Weapon Training talent, targets gain a +20 bonus on the test; this rises to +30 if
									the weapon is Heavy and the wielder is not braced. Cover does not protect from Spray
									attacks unless it completely conceals a target. Because there is no attack roll,
									they are always considered to strike the Body location. They jam if the firer rolls
									a 9 on any damage dice (before any modifiers are applied). Due to the inaccurate
									nature of their design, they cannot be used to make Called Shot actions.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Storm</td>
								<td>This quality doubles the number of hits the weapon inflicts on the target and the
									amount of ammunition expended.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Tainted</td>
								<td>Weapons with this quality inflict additional damage equal to the value of the user’s
									Corruption bonus or Daemonic (X) trait value (whichever is higher).</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Tearing</td>
								<td>These weapons roll one extra die for damage, and the lowest result is discarded.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Toxic (X)</td>
								<td>At the end of his turn, if a character has suffered damage (after Armour and
									Toughness bonus) in the last round from a weapon with this quality, he must make a
									Toughness test with a penalty equal to 10 times the number in parentheses (X) or
									suffer 1d10 additional damage (of the same type as the first weapon with this
									quality to damage him that round).</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Twin-Linked</td>
								<td>When shooting single shot, gain additional hit on 2 DoS on attack. When shooting
									Semi-Auto, gain additional hit per 3 DoS (3,6,9) on attack. When shooting Full-Auto,
									gain additional hit per 2 DoS (2,4,6,8) on attack. Additional hits are limited by
									weapon’s Rate of Fire.Evasion tests to evade Twin-Linked additional shots are 1 per
									2 DoS.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Unbalanced</td>
								<td>These weapons cannot be used to make Lighting Attack actions, and impose a –10
									penalty when used to Parry.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Unreliable</td>
								<td>An Unreliable weapon suffers a jam on a roll of 91 or higher, even if fired on Semi-
									or Full Auto.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Unwieldy</td>
								<td>Unwieldy weapons cannot be used to Parry or make Lightning Attack actions.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Vengeful (X)</td>
								<td>When attacking with this weapon, the attacker triggers Righteous Fury on any damage
									die result with a value of X or higher (before any modifiers are applied).</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Volatile</td>
								<td>When rolling for Righteous Fury, you roll additional 1d10 that can also generate
									another 1d10 on 10.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Deflagrate</td>
								<td>For every hit that inflicted at least one Wound on an opponent, resolve an
									additional automatic hit, rolling for damage as normal. These additional hits do not
									inflict further hits themselves.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Luminagen</td>
								<td>For 1d5+1 rounds, a target struck by a weapon with the Luminagen Quality does not
									benefit from the defensive or stealth enhancing capabilities of smoke, darkness,
									Cameleoline or similar conditions. Further, every round a target is affected by
									Luminagen, roll a 1d10, on a 9+, the character is set aflame.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Rad-Cleanse</td>
								<td>Any target struck by a weapon with the Rad-Cleanse quality, or any character within
									1m of a weapon with this quality during a reload must take a Challenging (+0)
									Toughness Test or suffer 1d5 Toughness Damage, on a natural 100, this damage is
									considered permanent.</td>
