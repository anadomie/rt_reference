								<td>73-78</td>
								<td><b>Blood Rain:</b> A psychic storm erupts, covering an area of 5d10 metres in which
									everyone must pass a Challenging (+0) Strength Test or be knocked to the ground. In
									addition to howling winds and the skies raining blood, any psychic powers used in
									the area for 1d5 Rounds automatically invoke Perils of the Warp, in addition to any
									Psychic Phenomena those powers cause. The psyker gains 1d5+1 Corruption Points.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>79-82</td>
								<td><b>Cataclysmic Blast:</b> The psyker's power overloads, arcing out in great bolts of
									Warp energy. Anyone within 1d10 metres (including the psyker) takes 1d10 Energy
									Damage with a Pen of 5. The psyker may not Dodge this, or stop the attack with a
									Field Save (see page 196). In addition, all of the psyker's clothing and gear is
									destroyed, leaving him naked and smoking on the ground. The psyker may use no
									further powers for 1d5 hours after the event.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>83-86</td>
								<td><b>Mass Possession:</b> Daemons ravage the mind of every living thing within 1d100
									metres. Every character in the area must resist a possession attack (see the
									Possession Trait in Chapter V: Talents and Traits; the attacker is a random Lesser
									Daemon). This possession will last for no more than 2d10 Rounds, after which the
									daemons are cast back into the Warp.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>87-90</td>
								<td><b>Reality Quake:</b> Reality buckles around the psyker, and an area radiating out
									3d10 metres from him is sundered: solid objects alternately rot, burn, and freeze,
									and everyone and everything in the area takes 2d10 Rending Damage, ignoring Armour
									(and unable to be dodged). Warded objects, daemons, and untouchables halve the
									Damage rolled.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>91-99</td>
								<td><b>Grand Possession:</b> A grand and terrible Warp entity takes interest in the
									psyker's soul, descending from the Warp to seize the mortal's body for its own
									purposes. A powerful Daemon attempts to possess the psyker (see the Possession Trait
									in Chapter IV: Talents and Traits). Use the Bloodletter from page 354, but increase
									all of its Characteristics by +20 and give it Fear 4. Even if the daemon fails, the
									psyker still suffers 2d10 Toughness Damage, and will forever add +10 to all rolls on
									the Psychic Phenomena and Perils of the Warp tables as his body now serves as a
									conduit to the power of the Warp. If the character dies while possessed, the daemon
									manifests in the real world for a number of days equal to its Toughness Bonus or
									until it is destroyed.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>100</td>
								<td><b>Annihilation:</b> The psyker is immediately and irrevocably destroyed, burned to
									nothing by the screaming fires of the Immaterium or dragged into the deepest
									maelstrom of the Warp. The psyker may not spend Fate to recover from this death, he
									is irrevocably destroyed. There is a chance that a daemonic entity of some sort
									appears in the psyker's place. The type of daemon that appears is determined by the
									GM, based on how powerful the psyker was - more powerful psykers draw more powerful
									daemons. The percentage chance that the daemon appears is equal to the psyker's
									Willpower characteristic (roll a d100, if the result is equal to or under the
									characteristic, the daemon appears).</td>
